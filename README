Spellingbee is a ruby gem that gives you spelling suggestions based on the
words present in a source file that acts as the dictionary. The alternate 
spelling suggestions are based on the frequency with which the words occur 
in the source file.

Usage
-----

Install the gem by using gem install spellingbee.

You can create a new spelling bee and call the correct method for a word.

  s = SpellingBee.new
  s.correct "speling" #=> "spelling"

Credits

This gem is based on the Python example in Peter Norvig's article "How to write
a spelling corrector". [http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html] 

Brian Adkins wrote a version of this code in ruby and the logic used within the
SpellingBee class is based on that code.
