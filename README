Spellingbee is a ruby gem that gives you spelling suggestions based on the
words present in a source file that acts as the dictionary. The alternate 
spelling suggestions are based on the frequency with which the words occur 
in the source file.

This gem is based on the Python example in Peter Norvig's article "How to write
a spelling corrector". [http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html]
